# Community Content - Docker

This folder contains content introducing Docker and demonstrating how to use it to run containerized apps in Azure. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Running Docker Containers in the Azure Container Service

The HOL may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
